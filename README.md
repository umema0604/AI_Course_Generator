One of the most exceptional projects I’ve worked on is AI-Powered Personalized Course Generator, which I designed and developed from the ground up. This platform leverages cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and integrates advanced APIs such as the Gemini API and YouTube API to dynamically curate personalized learning experiences for users.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
